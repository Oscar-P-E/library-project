      <h1>A Library of Books</h1>
      <p class="note">
        The form does not accept duplicate entries. Author names are
        standardised so J. K. Rowling and Joanne Kathleen Rowling are recognised
        as duplicates. The table display is sorted by book title alphabetically.
        I confess I used ChatGPT to style the table and form so that I don't
        waste time on colors and fonts. Sometimes 3 hours spent on "design" is
        really just procrastination. I used webpack in dev mode to bundle the js
        and css files to keep bundle.js human readable.
