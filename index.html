      <h1>A Library of Books</h1>
      <p class="note">
        The form does not accept duplicate entries. Author names are
        standardised so J. K. Rowling and Joanne Kathleen Rowling are recognised
        as duplicates. The table display is sorted by book title alphabetically.
        I used ChatGPT to style the table and form css. I just copied the files
        from /dist into the root directory in case somebody cares to look
        at my code. This is not what you would normally do with a real website.
